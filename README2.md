#  how to make an ec2 instance 
## Steps:
 1- Sign in to your AWS account. If you don't already have an account, you'll need to create one.

3 - Click the "Launch Instance" button to start the process of creating a new instance.

4 -Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for your instance. An AMI is a pre-configured virtual machine image that contains the necessary information to launch an instance.

5 -Choose an Instance Type. This determines the hardware resources that will be allocated to your instance. Select an instance type based on the requirements of your application.

6- Configure the Instance. This step involves specifying the details of your instance, such as the number of instances you want to launch, the network settings, and storage options.

7-Configure Security Group. A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic to and from your instance. You can create a new security group or select an existing one.
